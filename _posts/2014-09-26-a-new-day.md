A new day, a new website.

September 30th, the NZ Domain Name Commission allowed for people to register second-level *.nz* domains. This will be a 
radical shift in what is considered a normal domain, and I sincerely hope that kiwis catch on. Suffixing "dot co dot n z" 
is extremely clunky, compared with the succinct "dot com".
