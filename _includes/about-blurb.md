# About Me #

Hi, I'm Brynley - aka ZephireNZ (or Zeph, for short). 

I am currently working at 2degrees as a Data Analyst, providing our Customer Care team the data and insights they
need to make informed decisions. I previously worked as a Customer Care Specialist for over a year, so I have
hands-on experience dealing with mobile and broadband telecommunications.

I have a Bachelor of Computer Science/Logic and Computation from University of Auckland, where I graduated in 2016.

I've spent my life around computers, from building a website at the age of 12, to contributing to large open-source 
projects.

# My Skills #

I have a highly analytical mind, and a broad set of computing skills to match.

- Data Analysis and Reporting including SQL, Splunk, Excel and Tableau
- Full Stack Development, including Java, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS
- DevOps and Server Management, including Docker and Linux servers

Just to name a few! I am always willing to upskill and learn new concepts, stacks, and languages as as the need arises.
