# About Me #

Hi, I'm Brynley - AKA ZephireNZ (or Zeph, for short) online. 

I'm a 3rd year computer science student studying a the University of Auckland.

I've spent my life around computers, from building a website at the age of 12, to contributing to large open-source 
projects.

# My Skills #

I have over 3 years of experience working with Java. Primarily building customised "plugins" for a Minecraft server, 
but recently have started to dabble in Android development as a skill building excercise.

I also have some experience building bash and python scripts, however I'm by no means an expert.

While I can't call myself a senior developer with a decade of experience, I can say that I'm very quick to learn new
skills and languages, either for my own personal experience or as a requirement for a project. From a small API
function to a whole new framework, I enjoy discovering and playing with new things.
